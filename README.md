## Reinforcement & Imitation Learning based approach for challenge [`aido_LF`][lf]

This is a Reinforcement Learning based approach, more specifically **DDPG**, for one of the challenges in the [the AI Driving Olympics](http://aido.duckietown.org/).

[lf]: http://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/AIDO/out/lf.html


## Description

This is a solution baseline for the AI Driving Olympics competition using Reinforcement Learning & Imitation Learning in **PyTorch**, **Tensorflow**, and Tensorflow's **Keras**.
Most of the code is explained within its script as well as in the corresponding folder's README.

#### This repository can be used by anyone who would like to ground his/her knowledge in `Reinforcement Learning`, `Imitation Learning`, `PyTorch`, `Tensorflow`, `Keras`, and `Self-Driving Cars`
#### What you will learn & and get yourself familiarized with:
- Simulations in general and how to use them
- Image processing methods, use-cases  for Self-Driving Cars
- Reinforcement Learning and one method of RL, namely `DDPG` and its implementation in `PyTorch`
- Applying `DDPG` to: 
    - the "Hello World" of RL, namely [CartPole Problem](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/) a.k.a. Inverted Pendulum
    
    ![cartpole-gif](./tutorials/images/cartpole.gif)
    
    - a Self-Driving Car that learns itself how to drive well in different environments
    
    ![duckie-gif](./tutorials/images/duckie.gif)
        
- How Imitation Learning can be applied to Self-Driving Cars by training neural network models with both `Tensorflow` and `Keras`
- Submission to a world-wide competition using `Docker` 


## Getting Started
Go ahead and run all the scripts on Google Colab. You can train a reinforcement learning agent (expert) that learns to drive perfectly
within an environment. Then you can run the agent on a bunch of different maps/environments to collect data (observation &
action pairs) to imitate the expert's behaviour, a.k.a. Imitation Learning, Behaviour Cloning. Finally, you have an agent that
navigates within an environment using only one single sensor, the camera.
