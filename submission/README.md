# Submission
- `keras/`: the folder where the submission documents of the Keras model are stored
- `tf/`: the folder where the submission documents of the Tensorflow model are stored

---


Please follow [this link](/home/rizavelioglu/Desktop/challenge-aido_RL-IL/duckietown_rl/README.md) to do a dummy submission.
After that, you will be able to submit a model easily. Example for the Keras model:

```shell script
cd keras                   # cd into the submission folder
dts challenges evaluate    # evaluate the solution
dts challenges submit      # submit the solution to the challenge
```

After submitting the solution to the challenge, it will be accesible on the [Official Challenge Website](https://challenges.duckietown.org/v4/),
where you can see the **Leaderboard** as well as the **performance** of the submissions with detailed logs & statistics.
